The purpose of developing this project is to help educational institutions maintain accurate student information in a systematic manner.

It is designed for teachers, school administrators, and data entry operators who need to manage a large number of student details efficiently.

The system can replace paper-based record systems and reduce human error while improving data accuracy and accessibility.
